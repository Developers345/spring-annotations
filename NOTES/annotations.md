## 1. Why Annotations Come Into Picture?

- Annotations are meant to provide information about our classes to the Spring IoC container.  
- Both XML and Annotations are used to provide information about our classes to the container.  
- Annotations are an alternate way to provide information to the container.  
- Annotations came into picture due to the disadvantages of using XML.

## 2. XML Disadvantages

- XML is verbose (lengthy configuration). To define information for one class, we may need to write a minimum of 3 lines.  
- Developers need to remember the tags and their correct order.  
- XML does not support rapid application development.  
- XML has limited support from IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ).  
- Developers find it difficult to debug the application when any exception occurs in the configuration.
